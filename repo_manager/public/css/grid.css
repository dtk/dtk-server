/**
 * Modified version of the CSS grid (aka 1140 CSS) that can be found at http://cssgrid.net
 * 
 * This modified version has some extra enhancements to make it a bit easier to work with
 * the grid. Along with these minor fixes I also renamed all grid classes to the names
 * used by the 960 grid system as I find "grid_6" easier to write than "sixcol".
